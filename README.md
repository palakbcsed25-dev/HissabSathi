# HissabSathi
HissabSaathi — a peer-to-peer loan tracker with mutual TrustLock verification and tamper-evident payment logging, built with vanilla JS (no frameworks/backend).
HissabSaathi 🤝💰

Har Hissab, Saaf. Har Saathi, Secure. (Every account, clear. Every partner, secure.)

HissabSaathi is a peer-to-peer (P2P) loan management web app that helps friends and acquaintances track informal loans transparently. It uses a TrustLock mutual-verification system and a tamper-evident ledger concept so both the lender and the borrower must confirm loans and payments — reducing disputes over "who paid what, when."

This is a front-end only demo application — no backend server or database is required. All data is stored locally in the browser (localStorage / sessionStorage).

✨ Features
User authentication — register, login, and quick demo-account login
Dashboard — overview of loans you've lent and borrowed
Create Loan — start a new loan request between two users
Loan Detail — view full loan history, balance, and status
Log Payment — record a payment against a loan
Pending Verifications — approve/decline loans and payments logged by the other party
TrustLock security — payments are digitally signed using the browser's Web Crypto API (ECDSA P-256) and hashed (SHA-256) for tamper-evidence
Light/Dark theme support (persisted across sessions)
🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5 / CSS3 — index.html, css/styles.css
Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks/build tools) — a small custom SPA router + component system
Web Crypto API — for digital signatures & hashing (TrustLock)
Browser Storage — localStorage for data persistence, sessionStorage for auth sessions

🚀 Getting Started

Since this app uses the Web Crypto API, it must be run from a secure context — either https:// or http://localhost. Opening index.html directly via file:// may cause TrustLock signature features to fail (the app will still run, but with a warning in the console).

Option 1: Quick local server (recommended)
bash
# Using Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Then open:
# http://localhost:8000

Or with Node.js:

bash
npx serve .
Option 2: VS Code Live Server

Open the project folder in VS Code and launch it with the Live Server extension.

🔑 Demo Accounts

The app ships with pre-seeded demo data. You can log in instantly using the demo-login option, or manually with:

Name	Email	Password
Rahul Sharma	rahul@demo.com	demo123
Amit Verma	amit@demo.com	demo123
Priya Singh	priya@demo.com	demo123
Neha Gupta	neha@demo.com	demo123

Data resets to the seeded demo data on first load, and persists thereafter in your browser's localStorage. Clear site data / storage to reset the app.

📌 Notes
This project has no package.json or external dependencies — it's plain HTML/CSS/JS.
All "database" operations happen client-side; this is intended as a prototype/demo, not a production-ready financial application.
Do not use real passwords or sensitive financial data with this demo — it is not intended for production use.
